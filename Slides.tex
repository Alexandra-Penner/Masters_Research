\frametitle{Research Question}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What statistics are the best predictors of a team winning an NFL football game?

    \item Applications in sports journalism.

    \item Better understanding of statistics means better analysis. 

    \item preliminary research for developing an expected value approach to playcalling analytics.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Volume stats, moments for yards gained distribution, and Football Studyhall's "Five Factors"

    \item Moments: yards per play, variance, skewness, kurtosis 

    \item Volume Stats: total yards, number of plays, completion percentage,  time of possession 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
 
\begin{frame}{Five Factors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Success Rate: percent of plays that gain 50 percent of yards to gain on 1st down, 70 on 2nd down, 100 on 3rd or 4th.

    \item Explosiveness: percent of yard to goal line per play.

    \item Finishing Drives: points per possession inside opponents 40 yard line

    \item Average Starting field position: how far do you have to go to score

    \item Turnovers: number of interceptions lost fumbles
\end{itemize}    
\end{frame} 
 
\begin{frame}{Frame Title}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Logistic regression alone produced an F1 score of .871
    
    \item most predictive features: Turnovers, Points per trip, field position, Home completion percentage, Away Time of possession
\end{itemize}

\end{frame} 
 
 
\begin{frame}{Next Steps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item gains to be had in more sophisticated modelling
    \item addressing multicolinearity
    \item Trees, normalization
\end{itemize}
